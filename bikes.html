            <h2>Different Types of Mountain Bikes</h2>
            <p>Mountain biking is a diverse and thrilling sport, and the different types of mountain bikes reflect the various terrains and riding styles enthusiasts enjoy. Cross-country (XC) bikes are designed for speed and efficiency over long distances and varied terrain. They typically feature lightweight frames, 29-inch wheels, and narrower tires, making them perfect for climbing and maintaining high speeds on smoother trails. Trail bikes, on the other hand, are versatile and can handle a broader range of conditions. They usually have more suspension travel (around 120-150mm) and slightly heavier frames compared to XC bikes, providing a good balance between uphill efficiency and downhill control.

Enduro bikes are built for aggressive riding and technical descents, with long suspension travel (usually 150-170mm) to handle rough, steep trails. These bikes are still capable climbers but excel in descending, often used in enduro racing where riders tackle timed downhill sections with untimed uphill transfers. Downhill (DH) bikes take this a step further, designed exclusively for descending at high speeds on the most challenging terrain. With 200mm or more of suspension travel, robust frames, and slack geometries, these bikes are built to absorb massive impacts and maintain stability over jumps and drops.

Fat bikes stand out with their oversized tires, typically 3.8 inches or wider, designed for riding on soft, unstable surfaces like snow, sand, and mud. The extra traction and flotation provided by the large tires make them suitable for extreme conditions where standard mountain bikes would struggle. Dirt jumper bikes are specialized for jumps, tricks, and riding in skateparks or dirt jump tracks. They feature hardtail frames, minimal suspension travel, and strong, simple designs to withstand the impacts of jumps and stunts.

Each type of mountain bike caters to a specific style of riding and terrain, allowing riders to choose the best tool for their adventure, whether it be a long, endurance-based ride, a technical downhill race, or a playful session at the local jump park.
